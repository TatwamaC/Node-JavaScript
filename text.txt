Kehna hai, kehna hai	I want to say this, I want to say this
Kehna hai, kehna hai	I want to say this, I want to say this
Aaj tumse yeh pehli baar	To you today for the very first time
O tum hi toh laayi ho jeevan mein mere	You're the one who has brought in my life
Pyar, pyar, pyar	Love, love, love
Kehna hai, kehna hai	I want to say this, I want to say this
Aaj tumse yeh pehli baar	To you today for the very first time
O tum hi toh laayi ho jeevan mein mere	You're the one who has brought in my life
Pyar, pyar, pyar	Love, love, love
Tumse kehne wali aur bhi hai pyari baatein	I have more adorable things to tell you
Tumse kehne wali aur bhi hai pyari baatein	I have more adorable things to tell you
Samne sabke bolo kaise keh doon saari baatein	But how can I say all that in front of everyone
Aaj magar bas itna hi karna hai ikraar	Today I just want to confess that
Tum hi toh laayi ho jeevan mein mere	You're the one who has brought in my life
Pyar, pyar, pyar	Love, love, love
Kabse dil ne mere maan liya hai tumko apna	Since a long time my heart has made you mine
Kabse dil ne mere maan liya hai tumko apna	Since a long time my heart has made you mine
Aankhen meri dekh rahi hai jaagte sote yeh sapna	My eyes are seeing this dream all the time
Mere gale mein daal rahi ho tum baahon ka haar	You're putting the garland of your arms around my neck
Tum hi toh laayi ho jeevan mein mere	You're the one who has brought in my life
Pyar, pyar, pyar	Love, love, love
Kehna hai, kehna hai	I want to say this, I want to say this
Aaj tumse yeh pehli baar	To you today for the very first time
O tum hi toh laayi ho jeevan mein mere	You're the one who has brought in my life
Pyar, pyar, pyar	Love, love, love
Tum hi toh laayi ho jeevan mein mere	You're the one who has brought in my life
Pyar, pyar, pyar	Love, love, love
